/*
The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack a. To do so you have the
following operations at your disposal:

sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a.
Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.

sb (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b.
Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.

ss : sa and sb at the same time.

pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a.
Do nothing if b is empty.

pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b.
Do nothing if a is empty.

ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1.
The first element becomes the last one.

rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1.
The first element becomes the last one.

rr : ra and rb at the same time.

rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1.
The last element becomes the first one.

rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1.
The last element becomes the first one.

rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.
